# Project - 8 : React Todo App – Context API + LocalStorage

A clean and scalable **Todo Application** built with **React + Vite**, focused on mastering **Context API** for global state management and **LocalStorage** for data persistence.

This project demonstrates how to manage shared state across components while ensuring todos remain saved even after refreshing the browser.

## Project Overview

The app allows users to:

- Add new todos
- Edit existing tasks
- Mark tasks as complete
- Delete tasks
- Persist todos using LocalStorage
- Share state globally using Context API

## What I Learned

This mini project helped me understand how to combine **global state management** with **browser persistence**.

### Core Learnings

- Implementing Context API for application-wide state
- Using `useContext` for consuming shared data
- Synchronizing React state with LocalStorage
- Hydrating state on app load
- Writing clean and modular component architecture
- Avoiding prop drilling

## React Hooks Used

- **`useState`** – managing todo list
- **`useContext`** – accessing global state
- **`useEffect`** – syncing todos to LocalStorage

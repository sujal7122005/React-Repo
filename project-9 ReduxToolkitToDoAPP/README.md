# Project - 9 : React Todo App – Redux Toolkit

A scalable and modern **Todo Application** built using **React + Redux Toolkit**, focused on understanding centralized state management, reducers, actions, and store configuration in a clean and efficient way.

This project demonstrates how Redux Toolkit simplifies traditional Redux patterns while keeping the codebase organized and maintainable.

## Project Overview

This app allows users to:

- Add new todos
- Edit existing todos
- Delete todos
- Manage state globally using Redux Toolkit
